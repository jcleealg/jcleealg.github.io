Hello everyone!

Today, I'd like to share a small project I recently completed: an interactive web presentation on Fuzzy Systems in machine learning.

Fuzzy systems are powerful tools for handling uncertainty and imprecise information, mimicking human reasoning to enable machines to make more flexible decisions. This field has wide applications in control engineering, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

To better understand and demonstrate its core concepts, I created a presentation based entirely on web technologies. You can explore the fundamentals of fuzzy logic directly in your browser.

You can explore the project on GitHub or view the presentation directly:

*   **[View the Web Presentation](https://jcleealg.github.io/repr/)**

I hope this project is helpful for anyone interested in the topic!
