This post is a brief introduction to my machine learning project, `home_data_ml_practice`, where I practiced building a model to predict housing prices using a popular Kaggle dataset.

The project covers the complete data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. For a detailed walkthrough of the code, methodology, and results, please visit the project repository on GitHub.
