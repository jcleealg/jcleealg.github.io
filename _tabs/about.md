## About Me

I recently graduated from National Cheng Kung University with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics. My academic and professional focus lies at the intersection of mathematics and software development, with a particular interest in coding theory and algorithm design.

My master's thesis, "Loop Transversal Code," focused on constructing error-correcting codes (ECC) for arbitrary error patterns. The project involved several key stages:

- **Algorithm Development**: I implemented a greedy construction method for the code in Python. To enhance performance, I applied Dynamic Programming to optimize the mapping search algorithm, replacing less efficient combinatorial approaches.

- **Theoretical Contribution**: My research extended the algebraic framework from a binary field to an R-module and corrected erroneous propositions found in previously published work on the subject.

In addition to my research, I have practical experience developing tools to improve workflows. As a Teaching Assistant, I created solutions to automate and manage grading, submissions, and results compilation. My professional background also includes teaching mathematics and computer science, where I designed and taught an introductory cryptography course with hands-on labs.

## Technical Skills

- Python, SQL, Git, Linux, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning.
